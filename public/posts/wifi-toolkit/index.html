  "articleBody": "Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit 🚨🔐 Having dedicated the past year and a half to my final year project, I’ve successfully developed a powerful and hands-on Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit leveraging the capabilities of Python and Scapy on a Raspberry Pi. This project goes beyond theoretical concepts, providing a practical platform to simulate real-world wireless attacks and implement effective defense mechanisms.\nDesigned as both an educational resource and a robust security auditing tool, this toolkit offers invaluable hands-on experience with the offensive and defensive intricacies of Wi-Fi networks. Whether you’re a fellow penetration tester, a cybersecurity student looking to bridge the gap between theory and practice, or a hobbyist eager to explore the depths of wireless security, this project offers a unique and practical learning opportunity.\nIntroduction In today’s world, wireless networks remain a primary target for attackers due to inherent vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi protocol stack. Traditional tools often address either attack or defense — rarely both. This project bridges that gap.\nThe Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit is a Raspberry Pi-based solution designed to scan, attack, detect, and defend Wi-Fi networks in real time. Built using Python and Scapy, it provides hands-on insight into wireless attacks and mitigation strategies through a modular, menu-driven interface.\n1. System Overview The toolkit is built around four core modes:\nOffensive Mode: Includes deauthentication, beacon flooding, WPA2 handshake capture, MITM, and DNS spoofing. Defensive Mode: Detects deauth attacks, rogue APs, ARP spoofing, and triggers alerts. War Driving Mode: Logs surrounding APs and performs security audits based on encryption type. Automated Mode: Executes chained attacks autonomously — from scanning to key cracking. All modes are powered by Scapy for raw packet manipulation and Hostapd for fake AP creation. The toolkit also includes a real-time intrusion dashboard hosted on Flask, accessible via browser.\n2. Key Features ✅ Offensive Capabilities Deauthentication Attack Beacon Flooding / Fake APs WPA2 Handshake Capture ARP Spoofing \u0026 DNS Spoofing SSL Stripping \u0026 Credential Harvesting 🛡️ Defensive Capabilities Rogue AP Detection Deauth Detection ARP Spoofing Alerts Dashboard Logging with Timestamp 📍 Recon \u0026 Audit War Driving Module AP Security Score Classification (Open → WPA2-802.11w) GPS Tagging \u0026 Signal Strength Filtering 🧠 Educational Design Menu-Driven UI Modular Codebase for Custom Extensions Includes Real-World Test Results 3. Testing Methodologies 3.1 Unit Testing Each module was tested in isolation:\nPacket Injection Testing: Verified proper crafting of deauth and beacon packets. Handshake Capture: Ensured .cap files were compatible with Aircrack-ng. Fake AP Broadcasts: Confirmed visibility on client devices. Dashboard Logging: Checked accurate and real-time updates. 3.2 Integration Testing All modules were integrated and tested together:\nAutomated Mode Execution: Confirmed smooth transitions across attack stages. Defense Mode: Detected all injected attacks in near real-time. Recon + Audit Workflow: Seamlessly logged APs and calculated scores. 3.3 Performance Testing Measured under varying conditions:\nHandshake Capture Time: 3–7 minutes average (weak passphrases). Deauth Success Rate: 80–90% depending on AP proximity. Dashboard Latency: Alerts showed within 3–5 seconds. Resource Use: CPU/memory remained under 70% on Raspberry Pi 4. 3.4 Security Testing Real-world attacks were simulated:\nMITM + Credential Capture DNS Spoofing with Fake Google Login Resilience Testing with WPA2-802.11w Enabled APs 4. Contributions and Innovations 🔐 Protocol-Level Discovery Attempted to block deauthentication attacks via software filtering, but discovered that 802.11w (Management Frame Protection) was the most reliable solution. The toolkit thus recommends hardened APs using hostapd with WPA2 + 802.11w.\n🧰 Integrated Attack-Defense Framework Unlike other tools, this combines both offensive and defensive modules. Ideal for penetration testers, researchers, and students alike.\n🛰️ Real-Time Intrusion Dashboard Built-in dashboard shows:\nActive attacks Spoofed frames Detected rogue APs Deauth logs and timestamps 🧬 Custom Packet Engineering Every attack is custom-coded in Scapy, unlike tools like aircrack-ng that abstract low-level behavior. This gives fine-grained control for educational purposes.\n🔁 Fully Automated Mode Automatically loops through:\nScan for APs Select weakest one Launch deauth Capture handshake Crack password Log and move to next 5. Results and Analysis 5.1 Handshake Capture \u0026 Cracking ✅ 85% capture rate across test APs ⏱️ 3–7 mins average cracking time (weak passwords) ❌ Strong WPA2 passwords resisted dictionary attacks 5.2 Deauthentication Attacks 💥 90% success in client disconnection 📶 Best results within 10 meters ⚠️ 802.11w APs mitigated most attacks 5.3 MITM \u0026 ARP Spoofing ✅ 100% success on non-802.1X networks 🕵️‍♂️ Unencrypted traffic yielded credentials 🛡️ Detected within 10 seconds 5.4 DNS Spoofing ✅ Successful redirection post-ARP spoofing 🎯 Harvested credentials via fake Google login 🔓 Worked only on non-HSTS and HTTP sites 5.5 Rogue AP Detection 🔍 100% detection via SSID/MAC mismatch 🚫 85% DoS success on fake APs 🧭 Dashboard flagged excessive beacons in \u003c5s 5.6 Recon \u0026 AP Audit 📊 Logged 50+ APs in 500m radius 🧠 Classification accuracy: 95% Open / WEP / Weak WPA2 / WPA2+802.11w 5.7 Defense Mode 🛡️ 98% detection of deauth \u0026 ARP spoofing ⏱️ Alerts triggered within 3–5 seconds 🧱 WPA2-802.11w APs resisted 90% of deauths 5.8 Automated Mode ⚙️ 80% success rate in chained attacks 📆 4–6 minutes/AP on average 🔁 Skipped failed attempts to optimize workflow Conclusion The Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Toolkit is a unique, hands-on solution for learning, testing, and securing Wi-Fi networks. It doesn’t just execute attacks — it teaches how they work and how to mitigate them.\nWhether you’re a cybersecurity student, a red teamer, or a wireless researcher, this project provides:\n📚 A modular learning environment 🔐 Practical defense tools ⚔️ Real-world attack simulation 💡 Protocol-level insights With growing threats in wireless environments, understanding both sides of the security spectrum is no longer optional — it’s essential.\nNext Steps 📥 Project repo and codebase (coming soon) 📦 Install script for easy deployment 🧪 Add support for WPA3 and Evil Twin detection 💬 Leave feedback or contribute to future versions! Built with Scapy, Python, Raspberry Pi, and a passion for wireless security.\n",

<p>Having dedicated the past year and a half to my final year project, I&rsquo;ve successfully developed a powerful and hands-on Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit leveraging the capabilities of Python and Scapy on a Raspberry Pi. This project goes beyond theoretical concepts, providing a practical platform to simulate real-world wireless attacks and implement effective defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>Designed as both an educational resource and a robust security auditing tool, this toolkit offers invaluable hands-on experience with the offensive and defensive intricacies of Wi-Fi networks. Whether you&rsquo;re a fellow penetration tester, a cybersecurity student looking to bridge the gap between theory and practice, or a hobbyist eager to explore the depths of wireless security, this project offers a unique and practical learning opportunity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, wireless networks remain a primary target for attackers due to inherent vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi protocol stack. Traditional tools often address either attack or defense — rarely both. This project bridges that gap.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit</strong> is a Raspberry Pi-based solution designed to <strong>scan</strong>, <strong>attack</strong>, <strong>detect</strong>, and <strong>defend</strong> Wi-Fi networks in real time. Built using Python and Scapy, it provides hands-on insight into wireless attacks and mitigation strategies through a modular, menu-driven interface.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-system-overview">1. System Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-system-overview">#</a></h2>
<p>The toolkit is built around four core modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offensive Mode</strong>: Includes deauthentication, beacon flooding, WPA2 handshake capture, MITM, and DNS spoofing.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Mode</strong>: Detects deauth attacks, rogue APs, ARP spoofing, and triggers alerts.</li>
<li><strong>War Driving Mode</strong>: Logs surrounding APs and performs security audits based on encryption type.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Mode</strong>: Executes chained attacks autonomously — from scanning to key cracking.</li>
</ul>
<p>All modes are powered by Scapy for raw packet manipulation and Hostapd for fake AP creation. The toolkit also includes a <strong>real-time intrusion dashboard</strong> hosted on Flask, accessible via browser.</p>
