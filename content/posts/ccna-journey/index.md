## Starting My CCNA Journey — May 4, 2025  

After much planning and contemplation, I’ve officially kicked off my journey toward earning the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification. Networking is a critical pillar of IT and cybersecurity, and I know mastering it will level up my capabilities in meaningful ways.

It’s not going to be easy — and that’s exactly why I’m doing it.

## Game Plan  

For the next couple of months, I’ll be dedicating a few focused hours each day to study, review, and hands-on practice. Here's how I’m structuring my journey:

### 1. **Core Course**
I'm following the **"Complete Cisco CCNA 200-301" course by David Bombal**.  
His content is top-tier — practical, clear, and regularly updated. It covers everything from basics to advanced topics with labs, quizzes, and challenges.

My rule: **Don’t move ahead until I’ve truly grasped the current module** through repetition and lab practice.

### 2. **Daily Lab Work**
Hands-on experience is the foundation of my learning. I’m setting aside time each day to lab out what I learn using:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- GNS3 (for simulation when needed)
- Labs provided in Bombal’s course

Special focus areas for daily practice:
- Subnetting (mastery is a must)
- VLANs and Switching concepts
- Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)
- Network security and ACLs

### 3. **Mock Tests & Practice Questions**
I’ll test myself weekly to measure progress and retention. I’m aiming to simulate the exam environment frequently to build confidence and speed.

## Documenting the Process  

Although I’m not active on YouTube right now, I plan to document my journey through blog posts, notes, and study updates. This helps me track progress and may even help someone else in the same boat.

Who knows — maybe this will be the foundation for a future content series.

## Why CCNA?  

Because it challenges me. Because it’s respected. Because mastering networking makes me better at everything else I want to do in tech — from cybersecurity to cloud engineering.  

It's not about memorization. It’s about **understanding how the internet works at a foundational level**. That’s powerful.

Let’s get it. One subnet, one packet, one lab at a time.
