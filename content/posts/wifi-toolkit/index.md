# Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit 

Having dedicated the past year and a half to my final year project, I've successfully developed a powerful and hands-on Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit leveraging the capabilities of Python and Scapy on a Raspberry Pi. This project goes beyond theoretical concepts, providing a practical platform to simulate real-world wireless attacks and implement effective defense mechanisms.

Designed as both an educational resource and a robust security auditing tool, this toolkit offers invaluable hands-on experience with the offensive and defensive intricacies of Wi-Fi networks. Whether you're a fellow penetration tester, a cybersecurity student looking to bridge the gap between theory and practice, or a hobbyist eager to explore the depths of wireless security, this project offers a unique and practical learning opportunity.

## Introduction

In today's world, wireless networks remain a primary target for attackers due to inherent vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi protocol stack. Traditional tools often address either attack or defense — rarely both. This project bridges that gap.

The **Wi-Fi Offensive and Defensive Security Toolkit** is a Raspberry Pi-based solution designed to **scan**, **attack**, **detect**, and **defend** Wi-Fi networks in real time. Built using Python and Scapy, it provides hands-on insight into wireless attacks and mitigation strategies through a modular, menu-driven interface.

---

## 1. System Overview

The toolkit is built around four core modes:

- **Offensive Mode**: Includes deauthentication, beacon flooding, WPA2 handshake capture, MITM, and DNS spoofing.
- **Defensive Mode**: Detects deauth attacks, rogue APs, ARP spoofing, and triggers alerts.
- **War Driving Mode**: Logs surrounding APs and performs security audits based on encryption type.
- **Automated Mode**: Executes chained attacks autonomously — from scanning to key cracking.

All modes are powered by Scapy for raw packet manipulation and Hostapd for fake AP creation. The toolkit also includes a **real-time intrusion dashboard** hosted on Flask, accessible via browser.

## 3. Testing Methodologies

### 3.1 Unit Testing

Each module was tested in isolation:

- **Packet Injection Testing**: Verified proper crafting of deauth and beacon packets.
- **Handshake Capture**: Ensured .cap files were compatible with Aircrack-ng.
- **Fake AP Broadcasts**: Confirmed visibility on client devices.
- **Dashboard Logging**: Checked accurate and real-time updates.

### 3.2 Integration Testing

All modules were integrated and tested together:

- **Automated Mode Execution**: Confirmed smooth transitions across attack stages.
- **Defense Mode**: Detected all injected attacks in near real-time.
- **Recon + Audit Workflow**: Seamlessly logged APs and calculated scores.

### 3.3 Performance Testing

Measured under varying conditions:

- **Handshake Capture Time**: 3–7 minutes average (weak passphrases).
- **Deauth Success Rate**: 80–90% depending on AP proximity.
- **Dashboard Latency**: Alerts showed within 3–5 seconds.
- **Resource Use**: CPU/memory remained under 70% on Raspberry Pi 4.

### 3.4 Security Testing

Real-world attacks were simulated:

- **MITM + Credential Capture**
- **DNS Spoofing with Fake Google Login**
- **Resilience Testing with WPA2-802.11w Enabled APs**

## 4. Contributions and Innovations

### 🔐 Protocol-Level Discovery

Attempted to block deauthentication attacks via software filtering, but discovered that **802.11w (Management Frame Protection)** was the most reliable solution. The toolkit thus recommends hardened APs using `hostapd` with WPA2 + 802.11w.

### 🧰 Integrated Attack-Defense Framework

Unlike other tools, this combines both offensive and defensive modules. Ideal for **penetration testers**, **researchers**, and **students** alike.

### 🛰️ Real-Time Intrusion Dashboard

Built-in dashboard shows:

- Active attacks
- Spoofed frames
- Detected rogue APs
- Deauth logs and timestamps

### 🧬 Custom Packet Engineering

Every attack is custom-coded in Scapy, unlike tools like `aircrack-ng` that abstract low-level behavior. This gives fine-grained control for educational purposes.

### 🔁 Fully Automated Mode

Automatically loops through:

1. Scan for APs
2. Select weakest one
3. Launch deauth
4. Capture handshake
5. Crack password
6. Log and move to next
